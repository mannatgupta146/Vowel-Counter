# Vowel Counter

## Overview
The Vowel Counter is a simple form-based web application designed to count vowels from user input via a textarea and display the result below. The UI features a modern light blue gradient background with a clean, responsive design.

## Features
- A light blue gradient background for a visually appealing design.
- A centered container that ensures the content is easily accessible on different screen sizes.
- A styled textarea for user input with custom styling and animations.
- A button to submit the form, which triggers the vowel counting logic.
- Display of the vowel count below the form.

## How It Works
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter any text into the textarea.
3. Click the "Count Vowels" button to display the total number of vowels.
4. The application processes the input, counts the vowels, and displays the result below the form.
